### Building the thing

This project is divided into 4 parts
1.	The first part concerns parsing and reading input files
2.	The second part is a little more mathematical and concerns intersections and ray tracing
3.	Then the management of light, shadows and colors
4.	And finally all the graphic management (windows, hooks, etc.). with the minilibx
