	***MAGNITUDE****
The distance represented by a vector is
called its magnitude, or length. Itâ€™s how far you would travel in a straight line
if you were to walk from one end of the vector to the other.

Vectors with magnitudes of 1 are called a unit vectors,

Normalization is the process of taking an arbitrary vector and converting it
into a unit vector.

normalize a tuple by dividing each of its components by its magnitude
